## Project Workflow

### 1️. Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Converted raw data into structured Excel Table
- Standardized date format
- Created Year-Month column for time-based analysis

- Handled discount calculations

### 2️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Created multiple pivot tables to analyze:

- Revenue by Year
- Revenue by Month
- Sales by Region
- Category-wise Profit
- Top 10 Products by Revenue
- Discount % vs Profit relationship

Charts used:
- Line Chart (Trend Analysis)
- Bar Chart (Category & Product Comparison)
- Column Chart (Regional Sales)
- Scatter Plot (Discount vs Profit Impact)

### 3️. KPI Dashboard Creation

Designed a professional and interactive dashboard containing:

- Total Revenue
- Total Profit
- Total Orders
- Average Discount %
